# autoreply

This is an automated reply bot I made to answer frequent questions in my public community servers. It uses [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) to process messages and reply accordingly.

I wrote this after finding out that [jagrosh's Phoenix bot](https://github.com/jagrosh/Phoenix) (which does the same thing) was no longer maintained and used the now deprecated v1 version of the Dialogflow API
